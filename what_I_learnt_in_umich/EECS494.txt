                        What:What is the goal of the game?
                        How: What are the controls?
                             What are the mechanics that will help me accomplish the goal?
             Follow Up Questions:
                        What: What is going on right now?
                              What is my progress to the goal?
                        How: Are the controls I am using doing what I think they are?
             Method 1: Create a Separate "Tutorial Mode"

做Research:
Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime - The BattleBlock Theater
Cooperate:
 1.Use some small mechanisms, such as help other press the button.
 2.Division of labour
 1 is more flexible than 2
Aims:
 1.Two aims: 1.Collecting enough "love" 2.keeping the ship works
 2.Collect enough gems to pass the Game
 In 1, people need to make a balance between these two goals.
Enemies:
 1.All very big and can attack the spaceship, not individual people
 2.There are only some small Enemies
 In 1, people must to cooperate together, but in 2 people can kill enemies by
 themselves which makes people have less cooperative interactions.
