---------------------------------------------------------
  Lecture 2: Summary Statistic, Random Variables, and Distributions
    主要内容:学习一些衡量统计的指标
    Summary statistic
      1. Mean: Measures of Central Tendency
          Represent a typical value if the list is symmetric and has a
          single peak but isn't representative of a typical value if the list is
          skewed or has multiple peaks.
      2. Variance: Measures of Dispersion
          This measure works well if the list is symmetric, but are distorted by
          extreme values.(如果标准差大于平均值就不能作为measure of spread)
    Random Variables
      1.期望、方差和其关系
    Distribution:
      1.Binomial Experiment
      2.Continuous Random Variables
        PDF: probability density function

  Lecture 3: Sample Mean and Confidence Intervals
    主要内容：Sample Proportion/Population Proportion
    Sample Proportion -> Population Proportion
      mean: p
      standard deviation:根号(p(1-p)/n)
      confidence interval: 用R来算
    Population Mean:
      mean:μ

  Lecture 4: Hypothesis Testing
    Logical Framework

    the Correlation Coefficient:衡量是否线性相关
    the Equation of a Line
    Interpretation of this model:
      Intercept: represents the predicted price when income=0
        note: sometimes it isn't meaningful
      Slope: represents the predicted price increase when income goes by 1

  Lecture 7: Predicting
    Connection between Correlation and Slope:
      b1=r*sdp(Y)/sdp(X)
      SST: the total sum of squares
      SSR: the sum of squares due to regression
      R^2=(SST-SSR)/SST
    Errors:
      error (residual) standard deviation as s=根号(SSR/(n-2))
      standard error for the slope b1 as s/根号(Σ(Xi-X拔)^2)

      (package == 1)就是Dummy Variable
    多组比较：Analysis of Variance(ANOVA)
      E(mpg)= β0+ βE*(origin==“European”) + βJ*(origin==“Japanese”)
    Analysis of Covariance
      E(Time)=α0+α1(plant==1)+β0 Boxes+β1(plant==1)Boxes
---------------------------------------------------------
  Lecture 9: Spurious Correlation
    Interpreting to remove Interaction Terms
      1.There is no theoretical reason to believe that There is an
        Interaction
      2.Your sample size is large enough to detect interactions that are
        large enough to make a practical difference
      3.The interaction term isn't statistically significant and isn't large
        enough to make a practical difference
    Spurious Correlation -> Confounding Variables
    Regression Assumptions:
      1.The observations represent a representative sample from the population.
      2.The observation are independent.
      3.There is a linear relationship between the outcome and the predictors.
      4.The errors have constant variance.
      5.*（可有可无吧）The errors are normally distributed. This is not important
        with large sample sizes
    No-linear Relationship
      1.Adding a Quadratic Term
      2.Mean Centering
      3.Non-constant Variance
