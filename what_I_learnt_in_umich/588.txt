  Lecture 3: Attention
    主要内容:我们如何保持注意力
    Attention Resource -> Perception/Response Execution
    Attention Resource <- Thought/Decision Making
    1. Visual Search
      Top Down VS. Bottom Up Processing(一个个找 VS POP-OUT!)
      T=(N*I)/2 有逻辑的好找
      人们对一个页面会首先关注左上方
      Pop Out>Meaningful way search>Random
    2. Attention
      Selective Attention:Salience/Expectancy/Value/Effort
        Bottom-Up Processing: Salience
        Top-Down Processing: Expectancy and Value
        Both: Effort
      Implication:
        High Level: 我们不关注我们已知的东西/Context/目标导向和期望
        Mid Level: Avoid Ambiguity/Be Consistent/Understand User Goals
        Low Level: Visibility of Target/Cluttered Search/Structure Information
    3.Multitasking
      Resource Theory
---------------------------------------------------------
  Lecture 4: Memory,Learning and Individual Differences
    1. Memory
      1. How it works?
      Working Memory->Long-term Memory
      Working Memory:A temporary buffer for information currently in use
      2. Characteristics of Working Memory
      Small:7+2/Volatile
      Implication:
        chunking
        phonological loop/visuospatial sketchpad
        Repetition can lead to faulty recall
      3. Characteristics of long-term Memory
      Learning: the process of storing things in long term memory
        Automatically:物品内在有逻辑
        Through elaborative rehearsal:
          Commits information to LTM
          Associate new info with existing knowledge
      Retrieval from LTM
        Determined by Frequency and Recency of use
        Associtations between item and other stuff in LTM
      Learning Curve & Forgetting Curve
      How we retrieve information?
        Recognition VS recall
      How we store information in LTM?
        Schemas:比如一个狗,friendly\has tail
        Scripts:比如步骤
        Mental Models:比如自行车骑着可以往前
        Cognitive maps:比如脑海中SI的地下地图
    2. Individual Differences
      Experiment图：
        Minimal/Extensive Computer Experience
        Ignorant/Knowledgeable about Domain
        Novice/Expert User of System
---------------------------------------------------------
  Lecture 5: Thinking, Problem Solving, Mental Models
             & Affordances
    几乎要调动全部,除了Sensory Processing & Store
    1. Prospective Memory: Remembering to Remember
       Transative Memory: Knowing of who knows what
       Situation Awareness: Perception->Understanding->Projection/Prediction
       Metacoginition and Effort
    2. Characteristics of Good Design
       Discoverability & Understanding
       Solution: Human-Center Design
       Discoverability:
          Affordances
          Signifiers
          Mappings
          Feedback
          Conceptual Models
    3. How do people do things?
       Gulfs of Execution and Evaluation
       Goal: form the goal
       Plan: the action
       Specify: an action sequence
       Perform: the action sequence
       Perceive: the state of the world
       Interpret: the perception
       Compare: the outcome with the goal
    4. Human Cognition and Emotion
       Subconscious & Conscious
       Visceral -> Behavioral -> Reflective
       Visceral: subconscious, fast and automatic Quick Judgment
       Behavioral: Well-learned and largely subconscious actions
       Reflective: cognitive, deep and slow
---------------------------------------------------------
  Lecture 6: Motivation, Emotion and Habit
    Motivation
      Drive Reduction
      Self-Actualization
      Motivation as Arousal: The Yerkes-Dodson Law
    Emotion
      First, all emotions were innate
      Then, emotions mainly learned via social reactions
      Now, core set of innate emotions and other learned emotions
    Habit
      Trigger -> Action -> Feedback -> Reward
---------------------------------------------------------
  Lecture 7: Communication
    1. Communication:
      Communication is a collaborative activity
      Communication requires common Ground
      Communication is essential for joint action
      Different media provide different "constraints on grounding"
    2. Common Ground: what I know about what you know
      Common language/ Common capabilities/ Common reference/ Common knowledge
      Common vocabulary/ Protocol/ Culture/ History
      1. Forms of Common Ground:
        Conversational Conventions/ Communal Common Ground/ Personal Common Ground
      2. Common Ground and Joint Action
      3. Constraints on Ground
        Copresence/ Visibility/ Audibility/ Contemporality/ Simultaneity
        Sequentiality/ Reviewability/ Revisablity
    3. People are polite to computers.
      Grice's Maxims for Politeness: Quality/ Quantity/ Relevance/ Clarity
      Designing Good Behavior:
        Take an interest/ Be deferential/ Be forthcoming/ Use common sense
        Anticipate your needs/ Be conscientious/ Not burden you with their personal problems
        Keep you informed/ Be perceptive/ Be self-confident/ Not ask a lot of questions
        Fail gracefully/ Know when to bend the rules
---------------------------------------------------------
  Lecture 8: Social Cognition
    1. Who am I?
      Self-Concept: Set of all an individual's beliefs about his/her personal qualities.
      How do we know ourselves?
        Learning who we are by observing our own behaviors.
        Learning who we are from our thoughts and feeling.
        Learning who we are from other people's reactions.
        Learning who we are from social comparison.
      Multiple Selves
    2. Who am I Relative to You?
      Self-categorization
      Social Identity
      In-group VS. Out-group Process:
        People we think are like us we place in the in-group
        People we think are not like us we place in the out-group
        In-groups can become social groups
    3. Interaction with Others
      Norms and Conformity
      Public vs Private Conformity
      Groupthink
      Group Decision Making
      Majority and Minority Influence
      Conflict as a Source of Cognitive Growth
      Shared Cognition/ Group Memory/ Communication and Linguistic Interaction
---------------------------------------------------------
  Lecture 9: Experience
    Pragmatism
    Phenomenology
      Erlebnis: Conscious Experience
      Erfahrung: Everyday Experience
      Erlebnisse: Cumulative set of separate experience
    Experience VS an Experience
    Three levels of Experience: Why/ What/ How
    Threads of Experience
      Sensual
      Emotional
      Compositional
      Spatio-temporal
---------------------------------------------------------
  Lecture 10: D Cog(Distributed Cognition)
    1. Origin
      Three Problems:
        First problem: the approaches to studying human behavior were:
          Based on theories of Cognitive & Social Psychology
          Both were still primarily examined in experimental lab settings.
        Second problem: identify the user
        Third problem: cognition was in the head of individuals,
          involving processing, storing and retrieving of information.
      Summary:
        1. Context and work practices were important to understanding behavior.
        2. There are different types of users of a given system with unique goals
           and needs.
        3. Artifacts/tools are also used for cognition.
    2. Solution: D Cog
      1. Functional Description of a Cognitive System
                                  System Memory
                                      ↑
                                      ↓
Input → Sensory Mechanism  ←→  Information Processing ←→ Action Generation → Output

      2. Cognitive Psychology View
        Sensory -> Memory -> Information Processing -> Action Generator
        Representation: the way in which a system stores knowledge about a domain
        Representational Transformation: representation changes from one state to another
        Cognition/Computation: The propagation of representational state across a variety
          of [representational] media
      3. Perform a D-Cog Analysis
        Work Modeling
          Problem/Project/Goal
          Actors and Artifacts
          Inputs and Outputs
          Tools and Resources
          Functional Unit Organization
          Representation Generated/Transformed
          Project Outcome
          Breakdowns
          Suggested Improvements

---------------------------------------------------------
Project1: Happy Mahjong: An analysis of a happy game experience
Intro:
Happy Mahjong is an app for people to play mahjong on mobile devices.
This app is not only aesthetic but also functional: it has a cute graphic design
and allows people can play mahjong in different play modes and different levels.
It is very popular in China now. And everyone who has played it, including me has
a great experience with this app. In order to know why this app is so popular in
China and how it creates a great experience, I analyze my experience with it via
3 key concepts: Thumb-Size Targets, Visual Search, and Memory.

  Thumb-Size Targets:牌的大小的设定
  Visual Search:牌的顺序的设定，有些会亮POPOUT什么的
  Memory: 声音+牌的重复，让你知道啥牌 VS 用过的牌放在桌子中间只需要recognition不用recall

---------------------------------------------------------
Project2: Hearthstone: A balance of entertainment and competence
Intro:
Hearthstone is a popular online turn-based board game, whose background is the world
of Warcraft (another game produced by Blizzard Entertainment). This game was released
by Blizzard Entertainment on 2014 and soon became popular all over the world. [1] The
reason why it is so popular may be that all players, including me, have an enjoyable
experience with this game. In order to know how it can create such an enjoyable
experience, I analyze my experience with this game on iOS platform via 3 key concepts:
Signifiers, Common Ground, and Social Comparison.

  Signifiers:用绿色的外框标注一些可以做的操作，比如能用的卡标绿，快结束的时候“end turn”是绿的
  Common Ground:炉石里面的台词，比如“Well Played”都是来自魔兽的英雄，这算是一种Common ground
  Social Comparison:比较我的等级和对手的等级得知自己几斤几两
