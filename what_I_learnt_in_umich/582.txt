适用方向：UX
课程属性：project base
---------------------------------------------------------
这个需要搞个作品集？？？probably...
Overall:做设计是要去寻求一个解决方案
---------------------------------------------------------
项目名称:Zip Crit
  选择一样东西去做客观的分析
  What?这个东西是什么
  Pros and Cons:找它的五个优缺点
    exp. 它自身的优缺点
         它在与人交互上的优缺点
         使用它的时候，人与人交互中的优缺点
         它与环境交互的优缺点
  Social Impact:它的社会影响
---------------------------------------------------------
项目名称:Safety Cap安全帽
  Step1: Project Design Problem Statement
    1. Describe a specific neighborhood context
    2. Summarize what is currently being done in local
       neighborhood
    3. Describe the essential functions a tool would need to
       support this neighborhood in a robust way
  Step2: Competitive Analysis(竞品分析)
    1. Include four or more systems and articulates any deficiencies
       and strengths in respect to your proposed work
    2. "Bug List":
        物品名
        优点缺点*各个方面（比如做儿童物品要考虑 儿童、家长、产品本身、社会等因素）
  Step3: Sketching Alternatives
    Sketch 8 unique solutions, one in each square, writing a brief caption
    for each to help someone else understand the idea each sketch conveys
      * Focus on quantity not Equality
      * No two ideas should be alike
      * Include ideas from existing products or prior Research
      * Every caption should include an active verb, conveying what the
        solution does to address the problem
  Step4: Sketching Alternatives: Part2
    Sketch 5 workflows to help convey your design problem and solution.
    You should draw one workflow in each square and write a brief caption
    for each to help someone else understand the idea each sketch conveys.
  Step5: Personas 用户画像
    Develop 3 to 5 sample personas of sample users for your design. These
    may be chosen to be particularly emblematic of the audience(s) you are
    targeting. To make them as useful as possible, consider maximizing the
    diversity of characteristics amongst the personas to develop, such that
    they are illustrative of a wide range of user needs, motivations, skill
    levels and so forth.
    For example, three of these personas should be "pro" personas (e.g. this
    is who you are designing for) and at least one of these personas should
    be an "anti" persona (this is who you are not designing for).
  Step6: Story Mapping
    Create a storymap of your project, creating tasks and a narrative flow.
    Use your primary personas to capture variations of the tasks in the flow.
      Define the Project
      Write the narrative of the Project
      Green post-its mean activities.
      Yellow post-its mean core tasks.
      Orange post-its mean minimum tasks.
      Red post-its mean exceptions.
  Step7: QOC (Design Synthesis & Design Defense)
    Problem Statement
    Target Audience
    Target solutions
      Select three features
      Choose one critical features and analysis it
      Choose three approach to realize it (Draw three pictures)
      Write design rationale for each approach
      Use QOC diagram to decide the final decision
  Step8: Paper Prototype
